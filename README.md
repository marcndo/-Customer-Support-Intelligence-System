# Customer-Support-Intelligence-System

## Marcel Ambo Ndowah — Junior to Mid-Level Machine Learning Engineer

This repository contains an applied Customer Support Intelligence System designed to support real customer service workflows such as ticket categorization, prioritization, and insight extraction.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how I approach machine learning work end to end: from problem framing and data handling to modeling, evaluation, and documentation. Reviewers should assess this repository as they would an internal ML project prepared for collaboration and iteration.

## About

I am targeting a Machine Learning Engineer role at the junior to mid level, focused on applied ML systems that operate on real, imperfect data.

My work reflects the following principles:

Start from operational problems, not algorithms

Prefer simple, inspectable baselines before complexity

Separate analysis, production code, and documentation clearly

Document assumptions, risks, and limitations explicitly

The goal is not to showcase advanced theory, but to demonstrate sound engineering judgment and structured thinking.

## Portfolio Overview
This repository is organized to mirror how ML systems are developed and reviewed in production environments.

At a high level, it contains:

* Clear problem and system documentation

* Reproducible data and modeling pipelines

* Inspectable analysis and evaluation outputs

* Scripts that reflect real training and inference workflows

Each section is intentionally scoped and documented to support review, debugging, and extension.

# Customer-Support-Intelligence-System

## Marcel Ambo Ndowah — Junior to Mid-Level Machine Learning Engineer

This repository presents a Customer Support Intelligence System built as a professional machine learning portfolio project. It demonstrates how I design, implement, and evaluate ML components that support real customer support workflows such as ticket classification, prioritization, and insight extraction.

Reviewers should assess this repository as they would an internal ML system: by examining problem framing, data handling, model choices, evaluation rigor, and clarity of documentation.

## About

I am targeting a Machine Learning Engineer role at the junior to mid level, with a focus on applied ML systems that support business operations.

This project reflects how I approach customer-support ML problems:

Start from operational pain points, not algorithms

Translate support workflows into ML tasks

Build interpretable and maintainable solutions

Communicate limitations and risks clearly

I prioritize solutions that are understandable by engineers, data teams, and non-ML stakeholders such as support leads.

## Portfolio Overview

This repository contains artefacts required to build and review a Customer Support Intelligence System:

Problem definitions — business-aligned ML objectives

Support data pipelines — ticket ingestion and cleaning

Exploratory analysis — understanding customer issues and noise

ML models — classification and prioritization baselines

Evaluation reports — performance and failure analysis

Operational scripts — training and inference workflows

Each artefact exists to show how raw customer support data becomes actionable intelligence.

## What These Artefacts Show

Problem definitions map support needs (routing, prioritization, tagging) to ML tasks.

Data artefacts address messy, unbalanced, text-heavy support data.

Exploration notebooks inform labeling strategy and feature design.

Models start with interpretable baselines suitable for support teams.

Reports translate metrics into operational impact.

Scripts reflect how models would be used in a real support pipeline.

This mirrors ML workflows used in customer support automation and analytics.

Issue Handling and Review Approach

Customer support data is noisy and risk-prone. I handle issues explicitly.

Data gaps, label noise, and ambiguity are documented.

Misclassified tickets are reviewed and categorized.

Issues are assessed based on support impact (e.g., wrong routing vs. low-priority error).

Findings are written in plain language for both technical and non-technical reviewers.

This approach supports informed decisions about model readiness and deployment risk.

Technical and Workflow Depth

The system follows an end-to-end customer support ML workflow:

Define support objectives (e.g., ticket category prediction)

Validate incoming ticket data

Establish simple, interpretable baselines

Iterate with controlled feature improvements

Evaluate by class-level and error-type performance

Produce insights relevant to support operations

Data flows from raw tickets to processed features, into models, and out to actionable outputs such as predicted categories or priority levels.

## Tools and Skills
Skills Demonstrated

Translating support workflows into ML tasks

Text preprocessing for customer tickets

Feature engineering for short, noisy text

Supervised classification

Model evaluation and error inspection

ML system structuring for operational use

Tools Used in This Repository

Python — core implementation

NumPy / pandas — data handling

scikit-learn — modeling and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook — exploratory analysis

Git — version control and review

All tools are used in direct support of the system, not for demonstration only.

Professional Mindset

I treat customer support ML systems as decision-support tools.

I focus on reducing operational friction, not maximizing metrics.

I value interpretability for trust and debugging.

I validate models against real failure cases.

I document assumptions so teams can evolve the system safely.

My goal is to deliver ML systems that support teams can rely on and understand.
